</p>

MAFS is a programing language that uses variables and mathematical operators (that's what M stands for) to run.

MAFS is a cart / code loader which means that you can edit and write code wherever you want (even in notepad)
On the start there's something called <em>variable defining</em> . That means that you write the starter values of variables.
The best way to show you will be an example:
´
24 
36 
_ 
(add: 1 2 ) 
print= 1 / 
´
If you don't know what anything of this means, you are not the only.
So, back on track, section 24 36 _ is variable defining.
- 24 represents the first variable
- 36 represents the second variable 
- _ **represents the end of variable defining and starts behaviour**
